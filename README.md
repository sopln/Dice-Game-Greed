# Dice-Game-Greed
In this project I made a program that plays a dice game called Greed. I started with a program that allows only 2 players to play with each other. Then I build tools that let computer players play the game against each other.  

# Rules of the game
The game of Greed is a dice game between two players. The dice in question differ from regular dice in that they give numbers between 0 and 5, instead of between 1 and 6. The game begins with both players having a score of zero and proceeds in turns. The player whose turn it is can choose any number of dice to roll. They then roll those dice (all at once) and add the total of the dice to their score. If they go over 100, the other player is declared the winner. (A score of exactly 100 is acceptable.) Play then passes to the other player, who does the same. Play alternates in this manner until either one player goes over 100 and loses or a player chooses to pass. When a player passes (that is, rolls zero dice on their turn) the other player gets one more turn to roll, and then the game is over. If at that point neither player has gone over 100, the player with the higher score wins. (Ties are possible.)
